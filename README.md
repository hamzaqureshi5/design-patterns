## 📘 Overview

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems.  
They help in creating **flexible**, **reusable**, and **maintainable** code.

This repository covers the three main categories of design patterns:

1. **Creational Patterns** – Object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse.  
   Examples: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype

2. **Structural Patterns** – How classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.  
   Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy

3. **Behavioral Patterns** – How objects communicate and assign responsibilities.  
   Examples: Strategy, Observer, Command, Iterator, Mediator, State, Visitor
