# üß† Design Patterns

This repository contains implementations and explanations of common **Design Patterns** in software engineering.  
It serves as a reference and practice collection for understanding and applying design principles in **C++**, **Python**, and other programming languages.

## üìò Overview

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems.  
They help in creating **flexible**, **reusable**, and **maintainable** code.

This repository covers the three main categories of design patterns:

1. **Creational Patterns** ‚Äì Object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse.  
   Examples: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype

2. **Structural Patterns** ‚Äì How classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.  
   Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy

3. **Behavioral Patterns** ‚Äì How objects communicate and assign responsibilities.  
   Examples: Strategy, Observer, Command, Iterator, Mediator, State, Visitor

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/design-patterns.git
cd design-patterns


# For C++
g++ creational/singleton.cpp -o singleton && ./singleton

# For Python
python behavioral/observer.py

Would you like me to tailor it specifically for **C++ only**, or keep it **multi-language (C++ + Python)** like above?
